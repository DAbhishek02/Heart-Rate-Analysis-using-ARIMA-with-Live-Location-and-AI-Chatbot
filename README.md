# Heart-Rate-Analysis-using-ARIMA-with-Live-Location-and-AI-Chatbot
This project introduces a comprehensive health-tracking solution designed to monitor cardiac health in real-time. By leveraging Photoplethysmography (PPG) or ECG sensors, the system captures high-fidelity heart rate signals and processes them through an ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) time-series model.
